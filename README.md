Academism is a project that tracks Students and Staffs (Academic and Non-Academic staffs) activities. Students are being able to register their bio-data information as new entrants, they can as well register their courses, view and also add/delete course(s) in relevant instances. Lecturers (Academic staffs) can view the registered courses of students, even at the point where they did changes in their initially registered courses. Non-academic staffs are responsible for handling the results of students after their examination and many more abilities
